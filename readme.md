# Todo API with Redis Rate Limiting

This is a simple REST API built using [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) that allows you to fetch a list of todos. The API is protected by a rate limiter using the Upstash Redis service to prevent abuse. The rate limiter restricts each client to a maximum of 2 requests every 10 seconds.

## Features

- Fetch todo items by their ID.
- Rate-limiting implemented using the Upstash Redis service with a sliding window algorithm.
- Caching with an in-memory cache for ephemeral storage.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- Upstash Redis Account

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you need to set up the following environment variables:

- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`: The REST URL for your Upstash Redis instance.
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`: The authentication token for your Upstash Redis instance.

You can store these environment variables in a `.env` file or configure them on your hosting platform.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the following:

```bash
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_redis_rest_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_rest_token
```

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Endpoints

### GET `/todos/:id`

Fetches the todo item by its ID.

- **URL Parameters:**
  - `id`: The index of the todo item (e.g., `/todos/1`)

- **Response:**

  - On success: 
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Sample Todo",
      "completed": false
    }
    ```
  
  - On too many requests:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Too many requests"
    }
    ```

## Rate Limiting

This API uses the Upstash Redis rate limiter with the following configuration:

- **Sliding Window:** 2 requests every 10 seconds
- **Ephemeral Cache:** A built-in cache to reduce the load on the Redis server

## Tech Stack

- [Hono](https://honojs.dev/) - Web Framework
- [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) - Redis Service for rate limiting
- TypeScript

## Additional Information

- This project demonstrates how to use a rate limiter with Upstash Redis in a TypeScript project.
- The in-memory cache is implemented using a `Map` to store ephemeral data to reduce the load on Redis.
